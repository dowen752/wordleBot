# wordleBot
simple attempt at a bot that can play New York Time's Wordle game.

WordleBot and WordleWebBot utilize similar structure, but I use the
WordleBot for testing on scale, with a version of Wordle I made built
in Java.

WordleWebBot uses Selenium to play Wordle on the actual website.

wordleBotRunner allows for larger testing, running the subprocess 
version of the bot multiple times to determine accuracy rate.
